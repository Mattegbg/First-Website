            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Jens Ingemar "Ingo" Johansson  (born in Gothenburg 22 September 1932, died in Onsala 30 January 2009) was a Swedish professional boxer who competed from 
                1952 to 1963. He held the world heavyweight title from 1959 to 1960, and was the fifth heavyweight champion born outside 
                the United States. Johansson was awarded the Hickok Belt, the  
                only non-American to do so in the belt's entire 27-year existence. 
            </p>
            <h5>Early years</h5>
            <p>Johansson's introduction to the top rank of the sport was inauspicious. At age nineteen he was disqualified for passivity 
                at the Helsinki 1952 Summer Olympics in the heavyweight competition in a fight against eventual Olympic gold medalist 
                Ed Sanders. Johansson maintained he was not evading Sanders (who also got a warning for passivity), but rather was trying
                to tire his opponent. Johansson said he had been limited to a 10-day training camp, had only trained with newcomers, 
                and had been told by his coach to let Sanders be the aggressor. Nevertheless, his silver medal was withheld for poor 
                performance and only presented to him in 1982. 
            </p>
                <br>
            <P>    
                on 30 September 1956, he won the European Heavyweight Championship by scoring a 13th-round KO over Italy's Franco Cavicchi in Milan.
                Johansson successfully defended his European crown against ranked heavyweights Henry Cooper (fifth-round KO on 19 May 1957) 
                and Joe Erskine, with a TKO in round 13 on 21 February 1958.
                He affectionately named his right fist "toonder and lightning" for its concussive power (it was also called "Ingo's bingo" and the 
                "Hammer of Thor"), and in 2003 he was ranked at No. 99 on The Ring magazine's list of the 100 greatest punchers 
                of all time. 
            </p>
            <h5>Heavy weight champion of the world</h5>
            <p>Johansson earned his shot at the world heavyweight crown when he knocked out top ranked contender Eddie Machen in the first round 
                of their elimination match on 14 September 1958. In front of 53,615 fans in Ullevi football stadium, Johansson downed Machen three 
                times, finally finishing him with a barrage of punches at 2:16 of the first round. Johansson then signed to fight champion 
                Floyd Patterson.
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                He entered the ring in Yankee Stadium on 26 June 1959, as a 5–1 underdog. Johansson spent the first two rounds of the encounter 
                retreating and flicking a light left jab at the champion. In the third round, Johansson threw a wide left hook that Patterson blocked 
                with his right hand. When he moved his right hand away from its protective peek-a-boo position before his chin, Johansson drilled him 
                with a short powerful right hand. Patterson went down, arose on unsteady legs and was out on his feet. Johansson followed up his advantage 
                and sent Patterson down six more times in the round before the bout was stopped by referee Ruby Goldstein. Johansson celebrated with 
                his girlfriend and future wife Birgit Lundgren and the next day a headline in a New York newspaper expressed the city's amazement. It read:
                 "Ingo – It's Bingo." When Johansson returned to Sweden, he flew in on a helicopter, landing in the main football stadium in Gothenburg, 
                 his home town, and was cheered by 20,000 people. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, as well as the cover of Life Magazine 
                 on 20 July 1959, alongside Birgit.
